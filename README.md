## About the Video Course
TypeScript 2.x adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, giving you great tools and enabling you to structure of large JavaScript applications better. In this course, we’ll teach you how to leverage the exciting features of TypeScript while working on Angular projects to build scalable, data-intensive web applications. 
We’ll begin with an introduction to TypeScript and Angular framework, where you will install the TypeScript compiler and learn the most important secrets of the TypeScript language such as types, functions, classes, interfaces and start working in the Angular environment. The next section describes the introduction to components in the Angular framework using TypeScript. Using Angular CLI, you will create your first component, learn how to compose components, learn lifecycle methods in Angular, and respond to the user actions with events. The third section describes the services in the Angular framework, where you will learn about dependency injection and services in the Angular framework, create your first service, which will inject into the component and for service. 
The next section describes modules, directives, pipes and two-way data binding, where you will learn about modules in the Angular framework, find out what directives are and how to use them, create your own custom directive, add an external directive, transform data with pipes, and create two-way data binding in two ways. In the next section, you will learn how to create a reactive form, handle the form and validate the data. The sixth section describes the routing strategies, where you will create an example routing configuration, add links thanks to which it will be possible to navigate without reloading the page, handle routing. 
The last section is an introduction to testing and debugging, where you will learn about the tests, the types of tests, learn how to debug code using Chrome dev tools, and create component tests.
